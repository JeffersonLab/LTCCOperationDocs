a geometry file for CLAS6: (ccngeom.dat)
and a code for reading it: (ccdein.F)


focus positions: hpfseek, elfseek




x12, y12 define the max angles

hwde define the z width - read from ccngeom.dat , see ccdein




the theta of the elliptical mirrors are the in the last 18 numbers in ccngeom (see how they are read in ccdein)

I just grep those and put in separate .dat files
